Here is my file!
I started it at 2:45pm August 21st 2020 and finished at 6:22pm August 21st 2020 for a total of 3 hours and 37 minutes.
It is a Python file, so there shouldn't be anything needed to run it other than installing Python.
I left comments in the code to explain how it works.
Please let me know what you think and if there is anything else I can do!
